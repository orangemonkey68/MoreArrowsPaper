#MoreArrowsPaper
MoreArrows aims to add more types of arrows, with more functionality than vanilla Tipped Arrows. It **is not compatible with Spigot**.

##Why only Paper?
Because you should already be using it. Paper is built to give you the best performance. See [r/Admincraft's "What is Paper? And why you should use it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/93ble5/what_is_paper_spigot_and_why_you_should_use_it/) as well as the [guide on how to set up a paper server](https://paper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server/getting-started.html).

***MoreArrows is it's very early stages. It will not cause harm to your server, but it might not work all the time.***
